	  	I'm Lynn Vo, and I like computers and people.
	  	<p> I am an undergrad student studying both cognitive and computer science at UCSD (University of California, San Diego). Currently, I am a program manager intern at <a href = "http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx"> Microsoft</a>.</p>
	  	<p> I believe in learning and exploring, both for the purpose of self improvement. I am interested in the balance between cognition and technology, and its role in enabling people to pursue their passions.</p>
